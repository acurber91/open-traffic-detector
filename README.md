## About

This repository contains the **Open Traffic Detector** source code. It is a simple Python solution to track, count and estimate the speed, direction and classes of vehicles. Its main objective is to gather real-time data about traffic behaviour.

## Introduction

Open Traffic Detector is a case study for edge computing applications. It was designed to run in a Raspberry Pi 4B alongside the Google Coral USB accelerator to perform almost real-time vehicle tracking and detection. It is designed for online tracking applications so it can be modified to track other types of objects. It makes use of TensorFlow Lite, a lightweight TensorFlow implementation meant to achieve faster inference times and require less processing power.
